# CS3300-Project

A PHP form for a simple graduate student application stored in a MySQL database.

Running `copytoampps.bat` will copy all relevant website files (*.php, *.html, *.css, *.js) into the folder 
`%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Ampps\www\CS3300-Project`, or the files can be copied manually to 
whichever hosting service is being used.

To get started, run `setup.sql` on the database. Then begin your journey at `login.php`!
